Apache Yoko is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software

a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision
making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has
yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
