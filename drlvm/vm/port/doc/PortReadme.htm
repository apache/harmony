<title>Porting Layer Notes</title>
</head>

<body>

<h3>0. Preliminary Notes</h3>

The porting layer is a work-in-progress and is not yet shaped nicely.
Currently it consists of quite heterogeneous pieces (APR extensions, logger, 
encoder, utility templates etc) which do not form unified interface.


<h3>1. Design  Notes</h3>

The porting layer design adheres to concepts of APR (<a href="http://apr.apache.org/docs/apr/">Apache
Portable Runtime libraries</a>), specifically:
<ul>
<li>Explicit memory management based on pools
<li>Consistent error reporting approach via returned status value
<li>Incomplete types to enforce platform abstraction
</ul>
Detailed APIs mainly follow the APR standard, but there may not be strict correspondence
in signatures. Pure C should be used for implementation.

<!-- The below info is outdated
<h4>Using APR binaries directly</h4>
Harmony defines its own headers aligned with APR, but does not wrap APR functions
in code (no delegating calls). Instead, signatures are mapped directly to APR functions
where possible - via a set of defines, as follows:
<pre>
#define port_allocator_create(allocator) apr_allocator_create(allocator)
#define port_allocator_destroy(allocator) apr_allocator_destroy(allocator)
</pre>
<p>In this case, no run-time performance penalty is incurred. </p>
<p>The current approach has several significant advantages over using APR headers
  directly: </p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility to switch the portlib implementation to j9 or any other, including
  our own, at any time. In other words, the  internal portlib
  issues are hidden from API customers.
<li>Extensions to APR; currently, over 20 functions are implemented that are not
  part of APR. 
<li>Consistent naming of the whole porting API.
<li> Simplified bug fixing and tuning: several APR functions have been
  encountered that have flaws or are not suitable for DRLVM; these functions are
  easily replaced with Harmony's extensions.The same is applicable for VAV.
<li>Easier potential support for dynamic linking or multi-VM support with Harmony
  headers than with APR is: Harmony can organize VTables easier, unlike APR, which
  sometimes uses defines instead of real functions.
<li>Common headers to unify porting module build system with the DRLVM system: the
  APR build organization is completely different in that it uses different sets of
  headers for each platform, with specific defines. 
<li>Clearly identified subset of APR functionality, which is actually used, which
  may  be helpful for further VM porting.
</ul>

The key drawbacks of the current approach: 
<ul>
<li>Need for duplication of headers and documentation, though  redirection links
  to APR docs can be used to work around this flaw. 
<li>Potential compatibility issues with future APR development, for instance, on
  extension boundaries.
<li>Potential confusion in the open community, especially for those experienced in
  APR applications.
</ul>

<h3>2. Directory structure</h3>

Porting functionality is split to several groups: atomics, file I/O, mempools, etc.
Each group has a base directory, which contains subdirectories with actual code.
These subdirectories are named after the platforms and/or architectures they are
compiled on. If there is a strong dependency on both OS and machine architecture,
the subdirectory name should combine both. The current directory structure looks
as follows:
<pre>port
|->build
|->doc
|->include
|  ->tl
 ->src
  |->atomic
  | |->linux
  | |->linux_ipf
  |  ->win
  |->barriers
  |  ->linux_ipf
  |->crash_handler
  | |->em64t
  | |->ia32
  | |->include
  | |->ipf
  | |->linux
  | |  ->include
  |  ->win
  |->disasm
  | |->linux
  |  ->win
  |->encoder
  |  ->ia32_em64t
  |->file_io
  | |->linux
  |  ->win
  |->lil
  |  ->em64t
  |->logger
  |->malloc
  |->memaccess
  | |->linux
  |  ->win
  |->misc
  | |->linux
  |  ->win
  |->modules
  | |->linux
  |  ->win
  |->signals
  | |->include
  | |->linux
  |  ->win
  |->thread
  | |->linux
  |  ->win
  |->time
  |->tl
   ->vmem
    |->linux
     ->win	 
</pre>
<p>
Public headers are kept in a separate base directory named <code>include/</code>.
Implementation headers may be kept in the source directories.

<h3>3. Memory management</h3>

The port layer contains wrappers for standard memory allocation functions in the <code>port_malloc.h</code> file.
They are presented as defines with names like <code>STD_MALLOC</code> for malloc, <code>STD_FREE</code> for
free etc. By default, they are simply equal to relative functions, but if <code>_MEMMGR</code> is
defined, they are replaced with another set of functions like <code>port_malloc</code>, <code>port_free</code> etc.
These functions provide additional functionality at the expense of lower performance.
<p>
Newly provided features:

<ul>
<li>Report allocation and de-allocation log
<li>Check and report double free calling
<li>Report not freed memory at VM shutdown
<li>Provide precise info about currently used memory via the <code>java.lang.management</code> interface
<li>Provide separate memory allocation for the stress running conditions, like after
  crash handler occurring
</ul>

<h4>Instructions on using these features</h4>
<p>To switch on allocation and de-allocation logging, define the <code>_MEMMGR_LOG</code> macro.
  This macro also enables double free calling notifications. </p>
<p>For the final not freed
        memory reporting, define the <code>_MEMMGR_REPORT</code> macro. </p>
<p>
Currently, the stress memory allocator is defined not yet implemented, and just
  redirects to standard malloc. To switch on stress allocation, define the <code>STRESS_MALLOC</code> macro.
    <p>
The memory management module cannot use port logging because it leads to infinite
  recursion. Its own primitive logging system uses the file in the current directory
  with name <code>malloc.log</code> for
  both logging and reporting. A different file name and location can be defining <code>MALLOC_LOG_FILE_NAME</code>.
    <p>
Used memory could be obtained by means of the <code>java.lang.management</code> interface.
It is presented as non-heap memory pool with name <code>Native Memory Pool</code>.
Different pool name could be set by redefining <code>NATIVE_POOL_NAME</code>.


    <h3>4. Build system</h3>

Currently we reuse VM build system. <br>
TODO - document platform defines and macros.

<h3>5. APR issues </h3>
<ul>
<li>	Non-buffered file I/O on Windows* OS has bad support for <code>apr_file_eof()</code>
<li>	On Windows OS, <code>apr_dso_load()</code> fails on NULL path - 
		which is meant for obtaining a handle for the calling module itself
</ul>
